858,Innovative approach to safety messaging,"A hazards scavenger hunt, virtual race and safety bingo are among the innovative activities entered in the competition to celebrate National Safe Work Month.

Every October, SafeWork SA encourages South Australian businesses to host work health and safety events specific to their workplace and share them with SWSA.

A diverse range of businesses from medical research groups, government agencies, youth organisations and manufacturers took up the challenge and registered their customised events and initiatives that addressed risks specific to their workers. Activities were awarded points by a judging panel made up of WHS specialists, focusing on:

WHS relevance

employee engagement, and

The winners are:

The Hospital Research Foundation Group

The YMCA

Department of Human Services

Qscan

Adelaide Oval

Ashborn Industries

The judging panel thanked all of the participating organisations and said this year's entries and activities were the most engaging in the competition's history.

Gold Award winners

The Hospital Research Foundation Group

The Hospital Research Foundation Group left no stone unturned in its bid to highlight the importance of workplace safety during National Safe Work Month. Its activities included a ‘hazards scavenger hunt’ and a 90km virtual race to get its employees moving, as well as professional wellbeing sessions, videos and opportunities for staff to connect with ‘Mental Health First Aiders’. The organisation also opened its Brain, Body Fitness studios which offer staff low impact fitness sessions with a focus on friendly competition, improving physical fitness and raising awareness of the connection between physical and mental wellbeing. To cap off the month, all staff were treated to a catered lunch as an opportunity to unwind and spend some social time with their colleagues.

The YMCA

The YMCA introduced a ‘Youth Spruce your Storeroom Challenge’ complete with prizes for staff who came up with innovative safety solutions in storage areas. The challenge encouraged young staff members to imagine themselves in a manager’s role and share in the responsibility for safety. YMCA SA engages more than 400 young staff and volunteers and has identified safety concerns around lack of experience, awareness and insufficient skills and training. In this initiative, staff members were invited to transform their storerooms to a safe working space by identifying hazards, brainstorming ways to eliminate them and improving manual handling and traffic flow in confined or congested spaces.

Silver Award winners

Department of Human Services

The DHS invited its 28 Health and Safety Representatives to a comprehensive workshop entitled ‘Influencing Wellbeing and Safety in the Workplace’. The training provided insights, tools, and strategies to support the Department’s HSRs including tips on how they could best communicate and consult with staff and managers to influence safety in the workplace. In a second National Safe Work Month activity, the DHS hosted a leadership forum for more than 150 managers on ‘Psychosocial Safety’. The attendees received an introduction to psychological safety and a summary of what constitutes a psychosocial risk. The leaders were also provided with an overview of psychosocial risk regulations and the role of leaders in managing psychosocial hazards.

Qscan

The Qscan Group developed a comprehensive national response to violence and aggression in the workplace. The initiative encompassed a policy, procedure, zero tolerance posters, and specialised training modules to equip staff with the skills to identify potential risks and effectively de-escalate challenging situations. The pro-active, four-day training program was an excellent example of an organisation taking a pro-active approach to countering workplace aggression. The Qscan Group, in concert with World Mental Health Day, also launched a ‘happiness scorecard’ activity to give its team members an insight into their overall happiness and well-being.

Bronze Award winners

Adelaide Oval

Adelaide Oval held several educational and interactive activities to shine a light on the importance of safety in the workplace. These included Safety Bingo, in which team members were provided with a specially designed Safety Bingo card with elements such as hazard reporting, personal wellness goals, emergency procedures and training goals. Sixteen staff members received training in Mental Health First Aid to provide greater support to their colleagues. Staff and Adelaide Oval Ambassadors also received onsite skin checks from Medic at Work. The ‘Safety – Spot the Difference’ initiative had a different weekly focus with staff members from various departments challenged to ‘spot the difference’ and identify risks and hazards in the workplace. The month ended with a ‘Safety Amazing Race’ where staff completed tasks at four safety stops based on First Aid, Manual Handling, PPE and safety definitions.

Ashborn Industries

This small manufacturing business of less than 100 employees undertook a comprehensive program of activities throughout October at its regional and city offices. These included a detailed workplace noise assessment, safety awareness activities and weekly ‘Safe Morning Teas’ across all sites in October. It is the second year that Ashborn Industries has been recognised in the SWSA competition.",2023-12-07,https://www.safework.sa.gov.au/news-and-alerts/news/news/2023/innovative-approach-to-safety-messaging?queries_tags_query=#main,0.26620356102109566,"

1440,Shining a light on mental health in National Safe Work Month,"Mental health conditions accounted for 9 per cent of all serious workers’ compensation claims in 2020-21, a 55.6 per cent increase since 2016-17.

On average, work-related psychological injuries have longer recovery times, higher costs, and require more time away from work.

October is National Safe Work Month. It is a time to commit to building a safe and healthy workplace, free from physical and psychological harm.

This year’s theme – for everyone’s safety, work safely – encourages individuals and organisations to prioritise safety in the workplace, because protecting workers’ mental health is just as important as protecting their physical health.

The theme for Week 2 of National Safe Work Month is Working Together to Protect Workers’ Mental Health.

In line with this week’s theme, SafeWork SA has launched a new video Understanding Psychosocial Hazards in the workplace.

SafeWork SA has also launched a Mentally Healthy Workplaces section on its website, providing information on issues including work-related stress, psychosocial hazards, bullying and inappropriate behaviours and anxiety and depression.

New regulations under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 will help provide better guidance to workers and employers on how to manage the risk of psychological injuries and illnesses in the workplace will come into effect in December 2023.

These new regulations reflect the outcomes of an independent review of Australia’s model work health and safety laws in 2018, which recommended more specific guidance on how to identify and manage psychosocial risks.

Psychological illnesses have a significant effect on workers’ health, as well as business productivity.

There has been a growing recognition of the need for the work health and safety framework to better deal with risks of psychological harm.

Managing psychosocial hazards at work not only protects workers, it also benefits businesses by improving organisational performance and productivity.

As part of National Safe Work Month, SafeWork SA is running a webinar Unpacking South Australia’s New Psychosocial Regulations on Thursday 19 October. Register Now.

An online workshop, Managing Psychosocial Hazards and Risks, will be presented by ReturnToWorkSA and SafeWork SA on Wednesday 25 October. Register now for the workshop, which is suitable for employers, WHS Managers, RTW Coordinators and other Managers who would like to learn more about how to address psychosocial hazards & risks in the workplace.

2063,Dangers of bypassing safety devices,"Inspectors recently attended a worksite where a worker had become trapped in an automated computer numerical control (CNC) machine and suffered broken ribs.

An examination of the equipment found that the electrical interlock device used to prevent the machine’s door from being opened while in operation had been overridden with a home-made metal key – exposing the worker to dangerous moving parts. Inquiries are continuing.

SafeWork SA reminds businesses that disabling the safety features of CNC machines and any other automated tools can have serious consequences and is a significant breach of work health and safety laws.

Employers must ensure that safety devices such as electrical interlocks, light curtains, pressure mats and guards are not overridden and/or bypassed to undermine the safety features of any plant and equipment.

Regulation 208 (3) of the Work Health & Safety Regulations (2012) states the person with management or control of the plant must ensure that the guarding is solidly constructed, securely mounted, well maintained and not easily bypassed.

Penalties for failing to comply with the regulations attract maximum penalties of $6000 for an individual and $30,000 for a business.

Safety solutions

To reduce the risk of incidents and injuries, employers must:

Ensure plant with safety devices is regularly inspected and tested by a competent person to verify the safety devices are operating in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements.

Implement a system of work for the testing of safety devices prior to the operation of the plant. This may involve a daily checklist or similar system of work.

Ensure all workers required to use plant which has safety devices installed, are provided information, instruction and training on the correct operation of the devices.

Ensure workers and/or other persons do not deliberately bypass or override safety devices fitted to plant and equipment.

SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said safety locks and guards on machinery provide a physical barrier that when utilised appropriately and maintained provides a highly effective means of preventing injury or death.

‘Failing to have adequate control measures in place on items of plant, such as safety locks, can have significant life changing consequences for a worker,’ he said.
